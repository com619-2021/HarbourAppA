## Example Spring User and party Management

This folder contains two projects demonstrating  user and party managmeent and springMVC, SpringData and SpringSecurity.

One project uses Spring Java @Configuration [user-example](../user-project/user-example), 

the other  Spring XML configuration [user-example-xmlconf](../user-project/user-example-xmlconf), 

The [user-example](../user-project/user-example) project also contains a working swagger (openapi 3) configuration for users and parties.

Please note that this is work in progress and may be extended.
